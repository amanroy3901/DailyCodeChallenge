# DailyCodeChallenge 

Hey there! This is my daily grind solving DSA problems to sharpen my DSA skills. Iâ€™m an Android dev with 3 years of experience, aiming for the big leagues. Follow my journey as I tackle arrays, strings, trees, and moreâ€”one problem at a time!

## Structure
- **Arrays/**: Problems like Two Sum, Reverse Array, etc.
- **Strings/**: Reverse String, Longest Substring, etc.
- (More folders added as I progress!)

## Goals
- Solve 100 problems in 3 months.
- Push clean, working code daily.
- Land a top-tier Android dev gig!

## Connect
- LinkedIn: [[Aman Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanroy3901/)]

Happy coding! ðŸš€
